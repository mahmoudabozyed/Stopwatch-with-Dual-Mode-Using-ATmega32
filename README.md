# Stopwatch-with-Dual-Mode-Using-ATmega32
To design and implement a digital stopwatch with two operational modes: counting up  (increment mode) and counting down (countdown mode). The project utilizes an ATmega32  microcontroller, six multiplexed seven-segment displays (common anode), and multiple push  buttons for user interaction.
